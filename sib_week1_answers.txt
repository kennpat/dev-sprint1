In ‘sib_week1_answers.txt’ respond to the following:

What is a route, and how do you specify one in Flask?
	The route is what is returned on a get request. To specify one you have to define what will be returned when the get request is received. Otherwise you end up with a 404 error.


What is the only route we’ve specified in our application?
	@app.route("/")


What is the method that gets called when we hit that route?
	def hello():
		return "hello internet!"

If I wanted to add a route at “/world” that printed “Hello, World” on the #screen, what would that code look like?

	app.add_url_rule('/', view_func=View.asview('main'))


#If I create a new application and import testingflask.py (a.k.a. I am not running it directly), will code under the ‘if __name__ == “__main__”: be executed? Why not?

	I think it would be, because by importing the .py file that contains all the necessary stuff it would have also imported the 'if__name__... stuff.
